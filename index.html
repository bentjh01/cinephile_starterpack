          Hi, I'm a huge movie fan and I wanted to share some of my favorite movies with you.
          <br />
          This is is by no means extensive, there where many more I wished to include in it, and I hope you enjoy it.
          <br />

          The space between the edges
          <br />
          <br />
          This is a watercolor dreamscape where childhood innocence confronts the mysteries of the spirit world.
          Chihiro, adrift in a bathhouse of enchantments, grapples with greed, loss, and the bittersweet ache of growing
          up. The movie takes it's time to show the journey, leaving you there to breathe in the beauty of the world. A
          train ride across the water, walking down stairs, eating onigiri. Hayao Miyazaki, is a master of creating
          space.

            If there was a movie that had an epilepsy warning, it would be this. The animation in Spider-Verse is a
            kaleidoscope of vibrant colors, dynamic action sequences, and stunning comic book-inspired visuals.
            <br />
            But beneath the stunning visuals, a delicate thread of self-doubt weaves through Miles' journey. He
            stumbles, feels inadequate, grapples with the legacy of the mask. Yet, with each stumble, he gathers
            strength, embraces his own unique Spidey spirit, and proves that anyone, even a nervous Brooklyn teen, can
            wear the webs with pride. A love letter to the comics, it redefines "greatness" and opens a web of endless
            possibilities.

            Shaun of the Dead; A movie about growing up and taking responsibility for yourself and your actions. Also
            zombies. Edgar Wright is living very film lover's dream. He's a film lover creating films and it shows in
            his work. All his movies pay homage to films past. This film has that too, afterall it is called Shaun of
            the Dead after the classic Dawn of the Dead. Within its own world, he does this too with setups to be paid
            off throughout the movie.

            <br />
            <br />
            Interstellar: a cosmic symphony of grief, ambition, and the relentless quest for home. Time distorts,
            gravity bends, and family bonds stretch across light-years, leaving you aching for connection amidst the
            celestial vastness. Nolan's films showcase impossible problems like gravity-defying love and wormhole
            navigation, ultimately suggesting that humanity's ingenuity and compassion can conquer even the most
            daunting scientific riddles.o , Hans Zimmer's score stirs, and the film asks: how far will love drive us,
            and what sacrifices will we make for the echoes of tomorrow? In this case, love transends gravity and
            science will save us.

            There is a purity about Forrest Gump. He stumbles through history like a feather on the wind. From Vietnam
            jungles to ping pong tournaments in China, Forrest witnesses iconic moments with childlike wonder, reminding
            us of life's unexpected turns and the quiet beauty in ordinary days. Yet, beneath is not naiveté. Forrest
            watches love, trauma, and death around him yet maintains his purity. Choices shape our paths and Forrest
            chooses to be an ode to kindness, second chances, and the enduring power of hope.

            Prepare to be whisked away to a bygone era of European grandeur with Wes Anderson's whimsical masterpiece,
            The Grand Budapest Hotel. This visually stunning film follows the fastidious concierge Monsieur Gustave H
            (Ralph Fiennes) and his loyal lobby boy Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori) as they navigate a web of murder,
            theft, and family feuds, all while preserving the elegance of their beloved hotel.

            Whiplash: A pulse-pounding descent into obsession. Teller smolders as Andrew, a drummer yearning for
            greatness under the sadistic tutelage of Simmons' drill sergeant conductor Fletcher. Every cymbal crash hits
            you in the gut as the line between passion and abuse blurs. Whiplash is not just a movie about drumming,
            it's a searing exploration of ambition, obsession, and the cost of greatness. Director Damien Chazelle
            crafts a cinematic symphony of sweat, blood, and blistering jazz that will leave you breathless and
            questioning.

            Boyhood: a sun-drenched tapestry of growing pains, whispered secrets, and fleeting moments strung together
            like dandelion wishes. Linklater's camera whispers, never judges, as Mason (Ellar Coltrane) stumbles through
            boyhood's labyrinth. First loves bloom and fade, parental shadows loom and recede, friendships flicker like
            fireflies under summer skies. It's a bittersweet ode to the liminal space between childhood and adulthood, a
            celebration of the ordinary that leaves you yearning for long-lost afternoons and the bittersweet sting of
            nostalgia.

            <br />
            A neon-drenched cocktail of violence, redemption, and the absurd, shaken, not stirred by Tarantino's manic
            genius. Travolta's hitman twirls in dance halls, Jackson's Bible verses dance on bloody floors, and
            Thurman's mob wife navigates a world where adrenaline is the currency and consequences dance with fate. Each
            twisty narrative thread, each outrageous scene, asks: where does chance end and choice begin? A darkly comic
            meditation on violence, loyalty, and the thin line between luck and damnation.

            This movie about a talking cat has no business being ths good but it is. The animation is stellar; the
            adventure, exciting; And the story is captivating. It tackles themes mortality, self-reliance, and the
            importance of companionship. It is as if the writers wrote writing for two adiences, both children and
            adults. What makes this good? Because we are both audiences; we are the adults we are pretending to be and
            the children we are at heart.
